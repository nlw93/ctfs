# Hello World.
As I study for the OSCP I have been taking lots of notes. This site is meant to hosts writeups for the study activity.

Currently I'm working through The Ultimate OSCP Guide by John J. Hacking. I've done the OSCP labs and will be taking my exam soon. Many of the content posted here will be from HackTheBox or TryHackMe as I test my skillset and revisit topics I need to review.

Feel free to look around, reach out if something is amiss.
