# About this site

This site is to document my journey to OSCP. Each page is a brief write-up of how I hacked into a VM in a capture the flag (ctf). I started this site sort of late in my journey, so many of the write-ups will be for [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com)

## What is the OSCP?

The OSCP is a certification for Penetration Testing. The exam consists of a 24 hour simulated penetration test where the student must break into other computers on the exam network. After the exam, the student has 24 hours to compile their findings into a professional pentest report to be submitted for grading.

## Study plan

I've found [The Ultimate OSCP Guide](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/the-oscp-preperation-guide-2020/) by John J. Hacking to be a good guide as I prepare for the exam. After reading the whole article, I decided to start in the Intermediate section as it seemed to match my skillset the most. I've been meeting weekly with a study group for accountability and motivation. Before the Pentesting With Kali 200 (PEN-200) course, I completed the recommended TryHackMe paths. I also purchased a few courses from TCM Academy.

In December 2021 I completed the PEN-200 course. The course covered basic command line as well as complex topics such as setting up pivots and buffer overflows.
