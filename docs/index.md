# Hello World.
As I study for the OSCP I have been taking lots of notes. This site is meant to hosts writeups for the study activity.

Currently I'm working through The Ultimate OSCP Guide by John J. Hacking. I've done the OSCP labs and will be taking my exam soon. Many of the content posted here will be from HackTheBox or TryHackMe as I test my skillset and revisit topics I need to review.

Feel free to look around, reach out if something is amiss.


# About this site
This site is being made in Obsidian markdown editor to edit content. Then a github project is placed in the Obsidian vault. On commits, github's workflow builds the static pages which are then hosted as a github page.

# Fixes (my to-do list)
- The way I've been posting pictures is broken with this publish method. I need to look into a way to fix this for a lot of broken images.
- All the instructions say to point the page at gh-pages/docs but in reality it should point to the root dir - (evidenced by the .nojeckl file)
- Page linking?
- Theme changes?
