Most of those pages were behind a login page. I could only access
- `changelog.txt` - which mentions a recent patch FAILED, only patches 2 of 3 vulnerabilities.
![[Pasted image 20220203173133.png]]

- `xmlrpc.php` - which shows some XML error (probably because I'm doing a get request and it's expecting a POST with some command.)
![[Pasted image 20220203175941.png]]
Following [HackTricks guide to xmlrpc](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/wordpress#xml-rpc) I was able to get a list of valid commands. This can be used to brute-force creds if needed.


Do a POST with this payload:
```xml
<methodCall>
<methodName>system.listMethods</methodName>
<params></params>
</methodCall>
```

While researching how to use pfsense's XMLRPC, I came across [this exploit](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154587/pfSense-2.3.4-2.4.4-p3-Remote-Code-Injection.html). The exploit requires credentials, but **grants RCE**.

It looks like the exploit is using this XML payload to check the credential (only password I guess?).
```XML
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='iso-8859-1'?>"
<methodCall>
<methodName>pfsense.host_firmware_version</methodName>
<params>
<param><value><string>PASSWORD_HERE</string></value></param>
</params>
</methodCall>
```
So I will check this, and brute-force if possible.

Appears to be working! (Incorrect password)

![[Pasted image 20220203183855.png]]

Now for the brute-force....
Well, that was short lived. 75 requests worked, but now everything is timing out. In fact, it appears the whole webserver is down now. Wait....duh....my IP is probably deny-listed 

:'(

Reverting...Will have to do something different for the brute-force attack. I could try the name of the box as the password...
