## Day 1  - The Exam

### 7:40 am

Today (2/3/2022) I took time off work to do an OSCP practice exam.
The practice exam consists of the following:
 - 3 Active Directory HTB challenges. If I root all three I earn 40 points. No partial points awarded.
 - 3 "standard" HTB challenges. 10 points granted for each flag. Each box has user and root flag. Can earn up to 60 points.

Last night I finished scanning all the boxes and haven't looked at any of the scan results yet.

This morning I woke up feeling a little groggy. I probably shouldn't have stayed up programming till 1am :D

Helped get the kids ready for daycare, and now I'm getting started at 7:43.
The plan is to fully review and feel out potential exploits for all the boxes before trying to exploit any of them. Webserver enum will come last.

For the sake of simplicity We'll say I started at 7:30am, so I have until 7:29am tomorrow to complete this.


### 7:50 am

Apparently I wasn't connected to VPN while scanning yesterday.....

Adapt and overcome I guess :) - will start the morning by re-scanning each box. Going to have to pay attention to flow here and be sure to constantly be scanning something.

### 8:15 am

I went and had a fried egg sandwitch (dang eggs got over-done) and brew another cup of coffee while this first box is being re-scanned. This is a rough start so far, but I'm calm and not panicky. 24 hours should be pleanty of time to do everything I can. Plus I'm wearing a black hoody, so everything will be ok, right?

### 9 am

Just finished my first pomodoro break (5 mins). I did some stretching, meditated, and got more coffee. Back to hackin!


### 9:30 am

Just finishing second break. I'm starting to get a bit nervous that the failure to scan everything last night will kill my chances at completing this all in 24 hours. Guess we'll have to wait and see. HOOD UP.
